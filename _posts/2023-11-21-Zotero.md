# Zotero moved papers from collection to "unfiled items"
**Problem:** *Zotero notified me saying it has been a long time since my library was synchronised. I clicked "synchronise now" and all of my papers of one collection got moved to "unfiled items".*

**Solution:**

- My problem was caused by my online library not containing this particular collection, which is why upon synchronising, the collection got deleted locally and all of the papers got moved to "unfiled items".
- Follow the instructions of ["Restoring From the Last Automatic Backup"](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data#restoring_from_the_last_automatic_backup)
- Follow the instructions of ["If the online library contains unwanted changes that haven't yet synced to your current computer"](https://www.zotero.org/support/zotero_data#restoring_from_the_last_automatic_backup)
