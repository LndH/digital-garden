# Pyspark
## py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonRDD.collectAndServe

- Link Pycharm with PySpark: [Instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36415945/12497648)
    - On my mac (MacOS 14.0), installing apache-spark with Homebrew resulted in a different path to Spark: `export SPARK_HOME=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/apache-spark/3.5.0/libexec`
- I still had the error (py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError occurred while calling z:org.apache.spark.api.python.PythonRDD.collectAndServe) after following the above instructions, which I managed to resolve by setting a different environment variable in Pycharm as suggested [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76042851/12497648): `PYSPARK_PYTHON=python`
